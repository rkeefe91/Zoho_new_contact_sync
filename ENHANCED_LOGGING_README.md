# Enhanced Logging Configuration for Zoho Contact Sync

## What's Been Added

The script now includes comprehensive error logging and **data cleaning** that will help you identify and resolve both the INVALID_DATA errors and hidden control character issues you're experiencing.

### 1. Data Cleaning for Mobile Field Issues

**NEW: Phone Number Cleaning**
- **Function**: `clean_phone_number()` 
- **Purpose**: Removes hidden control characters that cause "invalid data" errors
- **Removes**: ASCII control characters (0-31, 127), non-printable characters
- **Handles**: NULL bytes (`\x00`), tabs (`\t`), carriage returns (`\r`), line feeds (`\n`), etc.

**Example Issue Resolved:**
```
BEFORE: '555\x00123\x014567'  # Contains hidden NULL and SOH characters
AFTER:  '5551234567'          # Clean phone number
```

### 2. Detailed Error Logging
- **Log File**: `./config/zoho_sync_errors.log`
- **Format**: Timestamped entries with structured error information
- **Content**: User email, account details, error codes, messages, and context

### 3. Error Categories Tracked

#### API Exceptions (Action Response Level)
- Status codes (error, success)
- Error codes (INVALID_DATA, etc.)
- Detailed error messages
- Field-specific issues (Mobile, Account_Name, etc.)
- User and account context

#### Response Exceptions (Response Object Level)  
- Similar to API exceptions but at the response level
- Provides broader context about request failures

### 4. Contextual Information Logged

For each error, the log includes:
- **User Email**: Who was being processed
- **Account Name**: Which account the contact was being associated with
- **Account ZID**: The Zoho ID of the account
- **Timestamp**: When the error occurred
- **Error Details**: All available error information from Zoho API
- **Data Cleaning Results**: Shows original vs cleaned values

### 5. Success Tracking
- Successful contact creations are also logged
- Contact IDs are recorded for successful operations
- Processing progress is tracked

## How to Use the Enhanced Logging

### Running the Script
1. **Test the Data Cleaning First**:
   ```bash
   python test_phone_cleaning.py
   ```

2. **Run the Enhanced Script**:
   ```bash
   python Zoho_new_user_contact_sync.py
   ```

3. **Check Logs**: Review both console output and detailed log file

### Analyzing Errors
1. **Use the Error Analysis Tool**:
   ```bash
   python analyze_errors.py
   ```
   
2. **Review the Log File Directly**:
   ```bash
   # View recent errors
   tail -50 ./config/zoho_sync_errors.log
   
   # Search for specific error types
   grep "INVALID_DATA" ./config/zoho_sync_errors.log
   
   # Search for permission errors
   grep -i "permission" ./config/zoho_sync_errors.log
   
   # Search for data cleaning activities
   grep "Cleaned mobile" ./config/zoho_sync_errors.log
   ```

### Common Error Patterns to Look For

#### Mobile Field Data Issues (NOW RESOLVED)
```
Code: INVALID_DATA
api_name: Mobile
expected_data_type: phone
```
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** with data cleaning functions

#### Permission Errors (STILL NEED ATTENTION)
```
Message: You do not have sufficient permission to associate this record
api_name: Account_Name
```
**Action**: Check user permissions for the Account_Name field in Zoho CRM

#### Invalid Account References
```
Code: INVALID_DATA
api_name: Account_Name
```
**Action**: Verify that the Account ZID exists and is accessible

#### Missing Account Mappings
```
ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND - No account exists in Zoho: [Account Name]
```
**Action**: Update your account mapping table or create the account in Zoho

## Data Cleaning Features

### Phone Number Cleaning
- **Removes**: Control characters, non-printable characters
- **Preserves**: Valid phone formatting (dashes, spaces, parentheses, plus signs)
- **Validates**: Minimum length requirements (7+ digits)
- **Logs**: Shows original vs cleaned values for debugging

### Text Field Cleaning
- **Removes**: Control characters from names, emails, LinkedIn URLs
- **Preserves**: Valid text content and formatting
- **Handles**: NULL values gracefully

### Smart Field Handling
- **Mobile**: Only added to record if valid after cleaning
- **LinkedIn**: Only added if contains valid content
- **Email/Names**: Cleaned but always included (required fields)

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Mobile Field Issues (Should be resolved now)
- ✅ Data cleaning automatically removes control characters
- ✅ Invalid phone numbers are skipped rather than causing errors
- ✅ Cleaning results are logged for verification

### 2. Permission Issues (Still need manual resolution)
- Check if the integration user has "Create" permissions for Contacts
- Verify field-level permissions for the Account_Name lookup field
- Ensure the user can associate contacts with the specific accounts

### 3. Account Association Issues
- Run the error analysis tool to identify problematic accounts
- Check if the Account ZIDs in your mapping table are correct
- Verify accounts exist and are not deleted/archived in Zoho

### 4. Data Validation Issues
- Review field mappings and data types
- Check for required fields that might be missing
- Validate account references before attempting contact creation

## Log File Examples

### Successful Creation with Data Cleaning
```
2025-08-05 10:30:15,123 - INFO - Attempting to create contact for user: john@example.com, Account: Example Corp, Account_ZID: 123456789
2025-08-05 10:30:15,125 - INFO - Cleaned mobile for john@example.com: '555\x00123\x014567' -> '5551234567'
2025-08-05 10:30:16,456 - INFO - Response status code for john@example.com: 201
2025-08-05 10:30:16,789 - INFO - SUCCESS - Contact created for john@example.com: Status: success
2025-08-05 10:30:16,890 - INFO - Contact ID created for john@example.com: 987654321
```

### Mobile Field Error (Should not occur anymore)
```
2025-08-05 10:30:20,127 - ERROR -   Message: invalid data
2025-08-05 10:30:20,128 - ERROR -   Detail - api_name: Mobile
2025-08-05 10:30:20,129 - ERROR -   Detail - expected_data_type: phone
```

### Permission Error (Still needs manual resolution)
```
2025-08-05 10:30:20,123 - ERROR - API_EXCEPTION - Failed to create contact for jane@example.com
2025-08-05 10:30:20,124 - ERROR -   Account: Problem Corp (ZID: 123456789)
2025-08-05 10:30:20,125 - ERROR -   Status: error
2025-08-05 10:30:20,126 - ERROR -   Code: INVALID_DATA
2025-08-05 10:30:20,127 - ERROR -   Message: You do not have sufficient permission to associate this record. Contact your administrator.
2025-08-05 10:30:20,128 - ERROR -   Detail - api_name: Account_Name
```

## Expected Results After Update

### Mobile Field Issues
- **Before**: `Detail - api_name: Mobile, expected_data_type: phone`
- **After**: ✅ Should be eliminated by data cleaning

### Your Specific Error Case
```
# This error for pranteekpatnaik@gmail.com should no longer occur:
api_name: Mobile
expected_data_type: phone
```

### Remaining Issues to Address
1. **Account_Name Permission Errors**: Need Zoho CRM admin to fix permissions
2. **Account Mapping Issues**: Need to verify/update account mapping table
3. **Missing Accounts**: Need to create missing accounts in Zoho

## Next Steps

1. **Test the data cleaning**: `python test_phone_cleaning.py`
2. **Run the updated script**: `python Zoho_new_user_contact_sync.py`
3. **Check for Mobile field errors**: Should be significantly reduced/eliminated
4. **Focus on remaining permission issues**: Work with Zoho admin on Account_Name permissions
5. **Use the analysis tool**: `python analyze_errors.py` to track improvements

The enhanced logging and data cleaning should resolve the specific Mobile field error you highlighted while providing better visibility into the remaining permission issues.
